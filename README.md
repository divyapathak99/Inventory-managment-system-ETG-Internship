# Inventory-managment-system-ETG-Internship
 Created an Inventory management system in which inventory of an electronic company is stored in a record.json file. And the system is made in such a way that users can add /update products in the inventory and can make purchases while keeping its record.  After every purchase, the records of the company sales are stored in the sales.json file.
